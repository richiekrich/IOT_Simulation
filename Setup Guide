NS-3 IoT Simulation Setup Guide
This guide will help you set up your environment, download the necessary tools, and run the IoT network simulation using the provided IOT.cc source code.

Prerequisites
NS-3 Installation: Ensure that NS-3 is installed on your system. You can download NS-3 from here. You can use the following steps to install NS-3:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g++ python3 cmake libc6-dev libc6-dev-i386 libclang-dev llvm-dev
    sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
    wget https://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.xx.tar.bz2
    tar xjf ns-allinone-3.xx.tar.bz2
    cd ns-allinone-3.xx/ns-3.xx
    ./build.py --enable-examples --enable-tests

For specific version updates or instructions, check the NS-3 Installation Guide.

Git: Install Git to clone and manage this repository. If Git is not installed:

sudo apt-get install git

NetAnim: To visualize the simulation, you need to install NetAnim. Install it by following these commands:

    sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev
    wget https://www.nsnam.org/release/netanim-3.108.tar.bz2
    tar xjf netanim-3.108.tar.bz2
    cd netanim-3.108
    qmake NetAnim.pro
    make
Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository, which contains the IOT.cc source code:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NS3-IoT-Simulation.git
    cd NS3-IoT-Simulation
    Setting Up the Project
    Navigate to the NS-3 scratch folder:

    cd ~/ns-3/scratch
Copy the provided IOT.cc file into the scratch folder:

    cp ../NS3-IoT-Simulation/IOT.cc .
Ensure that the IOT.cc file is located in the ~/ns-3/scratch directory.

Building and Running the Simulation
Build NS-3: You need to build the project in NS-3 after adding the IOT.cc file.

    cd ~/ns-3
    ./ns3 build
Run the Simulation: Once the build is complete, you can run the simulation:

    ./ns3 run scratch/IOT
Visualizing the Simulation: To visualize the simulation, make sure you have generated the XML output in your simulation file. After the simulation runs, open the animation file using NetAnim:

    ./NetAnim iot-animation.xml
Simulation Results
During the simulation, the UDP Echo Client-Server will send and receive packets between the sensor and cloud nodes.
The simulation outputs logs with packet send/receive timestamps.
Troubleshooting
Compilation Issues:

If you face issues during the build process, make sure all dependencies are installed (as mentioned in the prerequisites).
If the build fails, check the NS-3 documentation for troubleshooting common build problems.
NetAnim Visualizer Not Working:

Ensure that NetAnim is correctly installed using the steps above.
If you get errors regarding missing libraries, check that all dependencies (like qt5-qmake) are installed.
Network Behavior:

Make sure that the correct nodes, links, and IP addresses are being set up as described in the simulation code.
